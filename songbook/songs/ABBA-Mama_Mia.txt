[Verse 1]
D                                            G
I've been cheated by you since I don't know when
D                                        G
So I made up my mind, it must come to an end
D5              D+5
Look at me now, will I ever learn?
D6               D7                      G
I don't know how but I suddenly lose control
G                         A
There's a fire within my soul

[Pre-Chorus]
G     D   A
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
G    D    A
One more look and I forget everything, o-o-o-oh

[Chorus]
D
Mamma mia, here I go again
G
My my, how can I resist you?
D
Mamma mia, does it show again?
G
My my, just how much I've missed you
D              A
Yes, I've been brokenhearted
Bm              F#m
Blue since the day we parted
G        A
Why, why did I ever let you go?
D          Bm
Mamma mia, now I really know,
G      A
My my, I could never let you go.

[Verse 2]
D                                          G
I've been angry and sad about things that you do
D                                          G
I can't count all the times that I've told you we're through
D5              D+5
And when you go, when you slam the door
D6              D7                      G
I think you know that you won't be away too long
G                        A
You know that I'm not that strong

[Pre-Chorus]
G     D   A
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
G     D   A
One more look and I forget everything

[Chorus]
D
Mamma mia, here I go again
G
My my, how can I resist you?
D
Mamma mia, does it show again
G
My my, just how much I've missed you?
D             A
Yes, I've been brokenhearted
Bm              F#m
Blue since the day we parted
G        A
Why, why did I ever let you go?
D          Bm
Mamma mia, even if I say
G      A
Bye bye, leave me now or never
D
Mamma mia, it's a game we play
G
Bye bye doesn't mean forever
D
Mamma mia, here I go again
G
My my, how can I resist you?
D
Mamma mia, does it show again
G
My my, just how much I've missed you?
D             A
Yes, I've been brokenhearted
Bm              F#m
Blue since the day we parted
G        A
Why, why did I ever let you go?
D          Bm
Mamma mia, now I really know
G      A
My my, I could never let you go
