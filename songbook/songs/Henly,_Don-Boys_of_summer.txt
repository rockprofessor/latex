[Intro]
Em    C    D    C

[Verse 1]
Em
   Nobody on the road, nobody on the beach.
C
  I feel it in the air, the summer's out of reach.
D
Empty lake, empty streets, the sun goes down alone.
C
  I'm driving by your house, though I know you're not home.

[Chorus]
G                 D
But I can see you, your brown skin shining in the sun.
                                     C
You got your hair combed back and your sunglasses on, baby.
G                  D
I can tell you, my love for you will still be strong
                  C
After the boys of summer have gone.

Em    C    D    C

[Verse 2]
Em
   I never will forget those nights, I wonder if it was a dream.
C
  Remember how you made me crazy, remember how I made you scream.
D
  Now I don't understand what happened to our love.
C
But babe, I'm gonna get you back, I'm gonna show you what I'm made of.

[Chorus]
G             D
I can see you, your brown skin shining in the sun.
                               C
I see you walkin' real slow and smiling to everyone.
G                  D
I can tell you, my love for you will still be strong
                  C
After the boys of summer have gone.

[Verse 3]
Em
   Out on the road today I saw a Deadhead Sticker on a Cadillac.
C
  A little voice inside my head said: \&quot;Don't look back, you can never look back.\&quot;
D
  I thought I knew what love was. What did I know?
C
  Those days are gone forever, I should just let 'em go, but

[Chorus]
G             D
I can see you, your brown skin shining in the sun.
                               C
You got the top pulled down and radio on, baby.
G                  D
I can tell you, my love for you will still be strong
                  C
After the boys of summer have gone.

G             D
I can see you, your brown skin shining in the sun.
                                        C
You got your hair slicked back and those Wayfarers on, baby.
G                  D
I can tell you, my love for you will still be strong
                  C
After the boys of summer have gone.
