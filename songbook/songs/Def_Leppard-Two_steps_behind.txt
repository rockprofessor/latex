[Verse 1]
       Asus2
Walk away
D         G      D
  If you want to
       Asus2
It's okay
D         G      D
  If you need to
         Asus2   D             E     D
You can run but you can never hide
           Asus2         D            E    D
From the shadow that's creeping up beside you


[Pre-chorus]

     There's a magic running through your soul
    G                     E
But you can't have it all


[Chorus]
N.C.          Asus2
Whatever you do
        D           E             D         Asus2
I'll be two steps behind you (Wherever you go)
            D          E        D
And I'll be there to remind you
        Asus2         D             E         G
That it only takes a minute of your precious time
          D
To turn around
                     Asus2   D   G   D
I'll be two steps behind
       Asus2   D   G   D
Yeah, yeah

  To think about it
               Asus2      D                  G       D
Just walk the line, you know you just can't fight it
              Asus2     D                E    D
Take a look around and see what you can find
          Asus2       D            E    D
Like the fire that's burning up inside me


[Pre-chorus]
F#m7                             D
     Now there's a magic running through your soul
