(capo 2nd fret)

[Verse]
                           A
Well I guess it would be nice if I could touch your body
                D                         A
I know not everybody has got a body like you
                        A
But I've got to think twice before I give my heart away
            D                                          A
And I know all the games you play because I play them too

[Pre-chorus]
          D                       A
Oh, but I need some time off from that emotion
D                                  A
Time to pick my heart up off the floor
              D                  A       F#m7
Oh when that love comes down without devotion
          Bm                              E
Well it takes a strong man baby but I'm showing you the door

[Chorus]
                     A
'Cause I gotta have faith, I gotta have faith

Because I gotta have faith, faith, faith

I gotta have faith, faith, a-faith ah

[Verse]
A
BABY, I know you're asking me to stay
                     D
Say please, please, please don't go away
                            A
You say I'm giving you the blues
A
MAYBE, you mean every word you say
                D
Can't help but think of yesterday
                 A
And another who tied, me, down, to, lover boy rules

[Pre-chorus]
  D                A
Before this river becomes an ocean
  D                                     A
Before you throw my heart back on the floor
            D            A      F#m7
Oh-baby-I reconsider my foolish notion
        Bm                               E
Well I need someone to hold me but I'll wait for something more

[Chorus]
                 A
Yes I gotta have faith, I gotta have faith

Because I gotta have faith, faith, faith

I gotta have faith, faith, a-faith ah

[Solo]
A           D           A
                         I just have to wait, because I got to have
A           D           A
faith,      faith,      I got to, got to, got to have faith

[Pre-chorus]
  D                A
Before this river becomes an ocean
  D                                     A
Before you throw my heart back on the floor (I - just - got - to have faith)
            D            A      F#m7
Oh-baby-I reconsider my foolish notion
        Bm                               E                         N.C.
Well I need someone to hold me but I'll wait for something more....

[Chorus]
                   A
Cause I gotta have faith, I gotta have faith

Because I gotta have faith, faith, faith

I gotta have faith, faith, a-faith ah
