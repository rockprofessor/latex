[Chorus]
G                     Em
Well, where oh where can my baby be?
C                  D
The lord took her away from me
G                         Em
She's gone to heaven so I got to be good;
   C                        D          G
so I can see my baby when I leave this world

[Verse 1]
        G                   Em
We were out on a date in my daddy s car;
C                D
we hadn't driven very far
G                 Em
There in the road straight ahead;
  C                    D
a car was stalled, the engine was dead
G                    Em
I couldn't stop so I swerved to the right;
     C                 D
I'll never forget, the sound that night
    G                    Em
The screaming tires, the busting glass;
    C                   D       G
her painful scream that I heard last

[Chorus]
G                           Em
Well, where oh where can my baby be?
C                  D
The lord took her away from me
G                         Em
She's gone to heaven so I got to be good;
   C                        D          G
so I can see my baby when I leave this world

[Verse 2]
G                                 Em
Well, when I woke up the rain was pouring down;
C                           D
there were people, standing all around
G                     Em
Something warm, going through my eyes;
    C                  D
but somehow I found my baby that night
  G                              Em
I lifter her head, she looked at me and said
C                      D
hold me darling just a little while
  G                            Em
I held her close, I kissed her our last kiss;
  C                    D
I found a love, that I knew I had missed
    G                             Em
And now she's gone, even though I hold her tight;
  C                D          G
I lost my love, my life, that night

[Chorus]
G                           Em   
Well, where oh where can my baby be?
C                  D        
The lord took her away from me
G                         Em           
she's gone to heaven so I got to be good;
C                           D          G
so I can see my baby when I leave this world

G       Em
oooooooooo  4x
