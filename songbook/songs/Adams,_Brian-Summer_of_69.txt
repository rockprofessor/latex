[Intro]
D

[Verse 1]
D
   I got my first real six-string
A
   Bought it at the five-and-dime
D
   Played it 'til my fingers bled
A
   It was the summer of '69

[Verse 2]
D
   Me and some guys from school
A
   Had a band and we tried real hard
D
   Jimmy quit, Jody got married
A
   I shoulda known we'd never get far

[Chorus 1]
Bm             A
    Oh, when I look back now
D                         G
    That summer seemed to last forever
Bm           A
    And if I had the choice
D                    G
    Yeah, I'd always wanna be there
Bm                 A               D
    Those were the best days of my life

[Instrumental]
(D)   A

[Verse 3]
D
    Ain't no use in complainin'
A
    When you got a job to do
D
    Spent my evenin's down at the drive in
A
    And that's when I met you, yeah

[Chorus 2]
Bm                   A
    Standin' on your mama's porch
D                          G
    You told me that you'd wait forever
Bm                   A
    Oh, and when you held my hand
D                      G
    I knew that it was now or never
Bm                 A               D
    Those were the best days of my life
(D)            A                               D       A
         Oh yeah        Back in the summer of '69     Ohhh

[Bridge]
F               Bb
   Man, we were killin' time
        C
We were young and restless
   Bb/D
We needed to unwind
F          Bb                  C
   I guess nothin' can last forever, forever no

[Instrumental]
D    A    x2

[Verse 4]
D
   And now the times are changin'
A
   Look at everything that's come and gone
D
   Sometimes when I play that old six-string
A
   I think about you, wonder what went wrong

[Chorus 3]
Bm                   A
    Standin' on your mama's porch
D                         G
    You told me that it'd last forever
Bm                   A
    Oh, and when you held my hand
D                      G
    I knew that it was now or never
Bm                 A               D
    Those were the best days of my life

[Outro]
(D)            A                               D         A
         Oh yeah        Back in the summer of '69     Uh-huh
                      D         A
It was the summer of '69.    Oh yeah
                   D          A
Me and my baby in '69.       Ohhhhh, oh
D                   A                          D
         It was the summer, summer, summer of '69
  A      D      A      D      A
Yeah
