[Intro]
E  A  x2

[Verse]
E            A
When I was a young boy
   E            A
My mama said to me
      E                      A
There's only one girl in the world for you
        E                   A
And she probably lives in Tahiti

Chorus I:
           E
I'd go the whole wide world
           E
I'd go the whole wide world
        A
Just to find her

Break:
E  A

[Verse]
   E                  A
Or maybe she's in the Bahamas
          E                A
Where the Carribean sea is blue
E                     A
Weeping in a tropical moonlit night
        E                       A
Because nobody's told her 'bout you

[Chorus 2]
           E
I'd go the whole wide world
           E
I'd go the whole wide world
        A
Just to find her
           E
I'd go the whole wide world
           E
I'd go the whole wide world
         E             A
To find out where they hide her

[Chorus]
           E
I'd go the whole wide world
           E
I'd go the whole wide world
        A
Just to find her

Break:
E  A  x2

[Verse]
         E                     A
Why am I hanging around in the rain out here
E                   A
Trying to pick up a girl
           E                          A
Why are my eyes filling up with these lonely tears
              E                  A
When there're girls all over the world

[Verse]
       E                   A
Is she lying on a tropical beach somewhere
E                       A
Underneath the tropical sun
E                A
Pining away in a heatwave there
E                      A
Hoping that I won't be long

[Verse]
            E                        A
I should be lying on that sun-soaked beach with her
E                        A
Caressing her warm brown skin
    E                 A
And then in a year or maybe not quite
         E                        A
We'll be sharing the same next of kin

[Chorus 2]
           E
I'd go the whole wide world
           E
I'd go the whole wide world
        A
Just to find her
           E
I'd go the whole wide world
           E
I'd go the whole wide world
         E             A
To find out where they hide her

           E
I'd go the whole wide world
           E
I'd go the whole wide world
        A
Just to find her
           E
I'd go the whole wide world
           E
I'd go the whole wide world
         E             A
To find out where they hide her

[Outro]
E  A
