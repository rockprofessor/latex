[Intro]

Bb  F  Bb  F  (x2)

[Verse 1]
Bb
Sitting here wasted and wounded
              F
At this old piano
       Bb
Trying hard to capture the moment
               F
This morning I don't know
         Am                      Bb
'Cause a bottle of vodka's still lodged in my head
         F
And some blond gave me nightmares
                             Bb
Think that she's still in my bed
      Bb                     C                         F
As I dream about movies they won't make of me when I'm dead


[Verse 2]
        Bb
With an iron-clad fist
                               F
I wake up, and French kiss the morning
           Bb
While some marching band keeps its own beat
                      F
In my head while we're talking
      Am                         Bb
About all of the things, that I long to believe
       F
About love, the truth, what you mean to me
        Bb
And the truth is
 Bb          C           F   F  C  C*
Baby, you're all that I need


[Chorus]
         Dm Dm
I wanna lay
     C        Bb     F
You down in a bed of roses
       Dm  Dm
For tonight
  C          Bb     F
I sleep on a bed of nails
              Bb
Oh, I want to be
        F
Just as close as
    Bb   F
The Holy Ghost is
    Dm  C   Bb  Bb
And lay you down
Bb     Bb*    F
  On a bed of roses


[Verse 3]
          Bb
Well, I'm so far away
                              F
Each step that I take's on my way home
          Bb
A King's ransom in dimes
                                       F
I give each night to see through this payphone
        Am
Still I run out of time
         Bb
Or it's hard to get through
          F
Till the bird on the wire flies me back to you
      Bb
I'll just close my eyes, and whisper
Bb    C             F  F  C  C*
Baby, blind love is true


[Chorus]
         Dm Dm
I wanna lay
     C         Bb     F
You down in a bed of roses
       Dm  Dm
For tonight
    C         Bb     F
I sleep on a bed of nails
               Bb
Oh, I want to be
          F
Just as close as
     Bb    F
The Holy Ghost is
    Dm  C   Bb  Bb
And lay you down
Bb     Bb*    F     C
  On a bed of roses


[Bridge]
            Bb
Well, this hotel bar hangover
  C                         F
Whiskey's gone dry, the barkeeper's wig's crooked

And she's giving me the eye
   Bb
I might have said yeah
       Bb             C          F  F C   C*
But I laughed so hard I think I died, uh yeah!...


[Solo]
Dm  C  Bb  F  (x3)
Dm  C  Bb  Bb  Bb  Bb* F


[Verse 4]
        Bb
Now as you close your eyes
                        F
Know I'll be thinking about you
          Bb
While my mistress she calls me
                         F
To stand in her spotlight again
            Bb
Tonight, I won't be alone
                                      F
But you know that don't mean I'm not lonely
         Dm         C              Bb
I've got nothing to prove for it's you
          Bb       F   C
That I'd die to defend


[Chorus]
         Dm Dm
I wanna lay
     C         Bb     F
You down in a bed of roses
       Dm  Dm
For tonight
    C         Bb     F
I sleep on a bed of nails
              Bb
Oh, I want to be
         F
Just as close as
    Bb   F
The Holy Ghost is
     Dm  C   Bb     F  C  
And lay you down
         Dm Dm
I wanna lay
     C         Bb     F
You down in a bed of roses
       Dm  Dm
For tonight
    C         Bb  F
I sleep on a be...ed of nails!
           Bb
I want to be
         F
Just as close as
    Bb    F
The Holy Ghost is!
    Dm  C   Bb  (Bb)
And lay you down
(Bb)     (Bb*)   F
    On a bed of roses
