CAPO: II

[Intro]
G   Bm/F#   Em    C

[Verse 1]
G                   Bm/F#
I heard that you're       settled down
         Em                         C
That you    found a girl and you're    married now
G                 Bm/F#
I heard that your dreams came true
          Em                       C
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you
G                       Bm/F#
Old friend, why are you so shy?
           Em                  C
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light

[Pre-Chorus]
  D9                         Em
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
      C                 
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
    D9                          Em
I'd hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
         C               Em 
That for me it isn't o - ver

[Chorus]
G                  D                 Em    C
  Never mind, I'll find someone like you - ou
       G               D        Em  C
I wish nothing but the best for you too
         G         D           Em         C
Don't forget me, I beg, I'll remember you said
             G                 D                    Em     C
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instea - ead
             G                 D                    Em     C
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instea - ead

[Verse 2]
G                  Bm/F#
  You know how the       time flies
     Em                   C
Only    yesterday was the time of our lives
        G                    Bm/F#
We were born and raised in a      summer haze
      Em                     C
Bound by the surprise of our glory days

[Pre-Chorus]
  D9                         Em
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
      C                 
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
    D9                          Em
I'd hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
         C           D   Em   D
That for me it isn't o - ver

Don't forget me, I beg, I'll remember you said
             G                 D                    Em     C
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead, yeah

Regrets and mistakes, they are memories made
C                              Am    G          C       D
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?
