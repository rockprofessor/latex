Shed a tear cause I'm missing you

It'll work itself out fine
C              G              D     Dsus2 D  Dsus4  D  Dsus2  D
All we need is just a little patience

It'll come together fine

C
I sit here on the stairs
G
Cause I'd rather be alone
A
If I can't have you right now
D        Dsus2 D  Dsus4 D  Dsus2 D
I'll wait, dear
C
Sometimes I get so tense
G
But I can't speed up the time
A
But you know love, there's one more thing
D   Dsus2 D  Dsus4  D  Dsus2  D
To consider

[Chorus]
C             G
Said woman, take it slow

And things will be just fine

You and I'll just use a little patience
C             G
Said sugar, take the time
C                    Em
Cause the lights are shining bright
C                G                 D     Dsus2 D  Dsus4  D  Dsus2
You and I've got what it takes to make it

[Verse 3]
D
I've been walking the streets tonight
G
Just trying to get it right
D
It's hard to see with so many around
G
You know I don't like being stuck in the crowd

And the streets don't change but maybe the names
