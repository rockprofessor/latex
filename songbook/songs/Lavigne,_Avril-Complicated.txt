[Verse]
F
  Chill out, whatcha yellin' for?
Dm
  Lay back, it's all been done before
Bb                      C
  And if you could only let it be, you would see
F
  I like you the way you are
Dm
  When we're drivin' in your car
Bb                         C
  And you're talkin' to me one-on-one but you become

[Pre-chorus]
Bb
Somebody else 'round everyone else
       Dm
You're watchin' your back like you can't relax
       Bb
You're tryin' to be cool
                        C
You look like a fool to me - tell me

[Chorus]
Dm                            Bb              F
Why'd you have to go and make things so complicated?
  C
I see the way you're
Dm                          Bb                F
actin' like you're somebody else, gets me frustrated
C
Life's like this, you -
Dm                        Bb
  And you fall, and you crawl, and you break
          F
and you take what you get
         C           Gm
and you turn it into honesty
                                         Bb
and promise me, I'm never gonna find you fake it
      F

[Verse 2]
F
  You come over unannounced
Dm
  Dressed up like you're somethin' else
Bb                             C
  Where you are and where it's at, you see
                F
You're makin' me laugh out when you strike your pose
Dm
  Take off all your preppy clothes
Bb                             C
