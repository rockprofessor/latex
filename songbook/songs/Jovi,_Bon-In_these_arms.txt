[Intro]
E     E    Esus4   Esus4

[Verse 1]
          E                         Esus4
You want commitment, well take a look into these eyes
                E        Esus4
They burn with fire, until the end of time
               C#m                                 A
And I would give anything, I'd beg, I'd steal, I'd die
               Bsus4        E     Esus4       
To have you in these arms tonight

[Verse 2]
      E                   Esus4
Baby I want you, like the roses want the rain
            E                Esus4
You know I need you, Like the poet needs the pain
                C#m                               A
And I would give anything, my blood, my love, my life
             B  
If you were in these arms tonight

[Chorus]
E             B
I'd Hold you, I'd need you
C#m            A              E
I'd get down on my knees for you
         C#m           B
And make everything alright
                 A
If you were in these arms
E            B
I'd love you, I'd please you
C#m                     A
I'd tell you that I'd never leave you
E                              Bsus4
And love you till the end of time
                 A           E      Esus4 
If you were in these arms tonight

[Verse 3]
                   E                    Esus4
We'd stare at the sun, and we made a promise
                 E                  Esus4
A promise this world, would never blind us
                   C#m                         A
And these were our words, our words were our songs
                   C#m 
Our songs are our prayers, these prayers keep me strong
               A                 B 
And I still believe if you were in these arms

[Chorus]
E             B
I'd Hold you, I'd need you
C#m            A              E
I'd get down on my knees for you
         C#m           B
And make everything alright
                 A
If you were in these arms
E            B
I'd love you, I'd please you
C#m                     A
I'd tell you that I'd never leave you
E                              Bsus4
And love you till the end of time
                 A           E      Esus4 
If you were in these arms tonight

[Bridge]
      B
Your clothes are still scattered all over our room
      A
This whole place still smells like your cheap purfume
B
Everything here reminds me of you
         Asus2
There's nothing I wouldn't do

[Solo]
E    B   C#m   A    E    B   F#m   Asus2

Asus2                B
And these were our words, they keep me strong, baby.....

[Chorus]
E             B
I'd Hold you, I'd need you
C#m            A              E
I'd get down on my knees for you
         C#m           B
And make everything alright
                 A
If you were in these arms
E            B
I'd love you, I'd please you
C#m                     A
I'd tell you that I'd never leave you
E            G#m             Bsus4
And love you till the end of time
A                           E    B  C#m                 
If you were in these arms tonight
            A  
If you were in these arms..
