end of passion play, crumbling away
i'm your source of self-destruction
veins that pump with fear, sucking darkest clear
leading on your death's construction

hell is worth all that, natural habitat
just a rhyme without a reason
never-ending maze, drift on numbered days
now your life is out of season

i will help you die
i will run through you
now i rule you, too
