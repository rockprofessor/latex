[Verse 1]
                   A7
We passed upon the stair
                        Dm
We spoke of was and when
                  A7
Although I wasn't there
                        F
He said I was his friend
                      C
Which came as some surprise
                 A7
I spoke into his eyes
                    Dm
I thought you died alone
                   C
A long long time ago

[Chorus 1]
   C       F
Oh no, not me
  Bbm            F
I never lost control
       C       F
You're face to face
         Bbm                A
With the man who sold the world

[Verse 2]
                        A7
I laughed and shook his hand
                         Dm
And made my way back home
                        A7
I searched for form and land
                            F
For years and years I roamed
                 C
I gazed a gazely stare
                    A7
At all the millions here
                   Dm
We must have died alone
                   C
A long long time ago

[Chorus 2]
    C          F
Who knows, not me
   Bbm            F
We never lost control
       C       F
You're face to face
         Bbm                  A
With the man who sold the world

[Break]

[Chorus 3]
    C          F
Who knows, not me
   Bbm            F
We never lost control
       C       F
You're face to face
         Bbm               A
With the man who sold the world
