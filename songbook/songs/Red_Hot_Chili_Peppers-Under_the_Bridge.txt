[Verse 1]
E          B             C#m          G#m A
 Sometimes I feel like I don't have a partner
E          B           C#m     A
 Sometimes I feel like my only friend
       E      B            C#m     G#m A
Is the city I live in, the city of an-gels
E         B       C#m       A     Emaj7
Lonely as I am, together we cry

[Verse 2]
  E            B              C#m         G#m A
I drive on her streets 'cause she's my companion
  E                B                C#m         A
I walk through her hills 'cause she knows who I am
    E            B             C#m       G#m A
She sees my good deeds and she kisses me win-dy
E       B          C#m       A     Emaj7
I never worry, now that is a lie

[Chorus]
      F#m                  E    B*     F#m
Well, I don't ever want to feel like I did that day
F#m                    E     B*      F#m
Take me to the place I love, take me all the way
F#m                  E    B*     F#m
I don't ever want to feel like I did that day
F#m                    E     B*      F#m       E  B    C#m    G#m A  E  B   C#m  A
Take me to the place I love, take me all the way, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
     E         B                  C#m    G#m A
It's hard to believe that there's nobody out there
     E         B          C#m      A
It's hard to believe that I'm all alone
   E            B             C#m      G#m   A
At least I have her love, the city she loves me
E         B       C#m       A     Emaj7
Lonely as I am, together we cry

[Chorus]
      F#m                  E    B*     F#m
Well, I don't ever want to feel like I did that day
F#m                    E     B*      F#m
Take me to the place I love, take me all the way
      F#m                  E    B*     F#m
Well, I don't ever want to feel like I did that day
F#m                    E     B*      F#m       A  Am    G     Fmaj7
Take me to the place I love, take me all the way, yeah, yeah, yeah
