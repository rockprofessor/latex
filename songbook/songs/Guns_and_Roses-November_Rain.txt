[Verse 1]
F                       Dm
  When I look into your eyes
                    C
I can see a love restrained
F                    Dm
  But darling when I hold you
                          C
Don't you know I feel the same
Dm                        G
  'Cause nothin' lasts forever
                            C
And we both know hearts can change
Dm                         G
   And it's hard to hold a candle
                     C
In the cold November rain

[Verse 2]
F                                 Dm
  We've been through this such a long, long time
                        C
Just tryin' to kill the pain, oh yeah
    F
But lovers always come and lovers always go
    Dm                                      C
And no one's really sure who's lettin' go today, walkin' away
   F
If we could take the time to lay it on the line
        Dm
I could rest my head
                           C
Just knowin' that you were mine, all mine
Dm                   G
   So if you want to love me
                     C
Then darlin' don't refrain
Dm                     G
   Or I'll just end up walkin'
                     C
In the cold November rain

[Chorus]
       F                      G
Do you need some time on your own?
       F                   G
Do you need some time all alone?
          F                        G
Everybody needs some time on their own
                   F                   G
Don't you know you need some time all alone

[Bridge]
Em             F               C
   I know it's hard to keep an open heart
Em           F                   Dm
   When even friends seem out to harm you
Em         F               C
   But if you could heal a broken heart
Em          F              G
   Wouldn't time be out to charm you

| Dm | G  | C  | C  | (x2)

[Chorus]
            F                    G
Sometimes I need some time on my own
            F                   G
Sometimes I need some time all alone
          F                        G
Everybody needs some time on their own
                   F                   G
Don't you know you need some time all alone

[Solo 2]
| F  | Dm | C  | C  | (x2)

[Verse 3]
F                        Dm
  And when your fears subside
                    C
And shadows still remain, oh yeah
F                     Dm
  I know that you can love me
                            C
When there's no one left to blame
Dm                   G
   So never mind the darkness
                    C
We still can find a way
Dm                        G
  'Cause nothin' lasts forever
                   (C)
Even cold November rain

   Don't you you think that you need somebody
F                          Eb
  Don't you think that you need someone
Ab           Bb            C5
   Everybody needs somebody. You're not the only one.  You're not the only one.
