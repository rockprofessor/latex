[Intro]

[Verse 1]
   Em7            Cadd9     G                        Dsus/F#
Disarm you with a smile and cut you like you want me to
Em7             Cadd9   G                     Dsus/F# Em7
Cut that little child inside of me and such a part of you

Oh hoo the years burn

    Oh hoo the years burn

[Chorus]
Cadd9                     Em7    Dsus      Cadd9
    I used to be a little boy so old in my shoes
Cadd9                       Em7             Dsus           Cadd9
    And what I choose is my choice what's a boy supposed to do
Cadd9                                 Em7    Dsus
    The killer in me is the killer in you my love
Cadd9                         Em7   D   Em7   D   Cadd9
    I send this smile over to you

[Verse 2]
   Em7            Cadd9        G                Dsus/F#
Disarm you with a smile and leave you like they left me here
   Em7          Cadd9    G                       Dsus/F#
To whither in denial the bitterness of one who's left alone
Em7    Cadd9         G    Dsus/F#
    Oh hoo the years burn
Em7    Cadd9         G    Dsus Cadd9
    Oh hoo the years burn burn burn

[Chorus]
Cadd9                     Em7    Dsus      Cadd9
    I used to be a little boy so old in my shoes
Cadd9                       Em7            Dsus            Cadd9
    And what I choose is my voice what's a boy supposed to do
Cadd9                                 Em7    Dsus
    The killer in me is the killer in you my love
Cadd9                         Dsus
    I send this smile over to you

    I send this smile over to you
Dsus             Em7                 Cadd9
    The killer in me is the killer in you
                              Dsus
    I send this smile over to you
Dsus              Em7                 Cadd9
