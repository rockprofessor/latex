[Verse 1]
E                         D
All I can say is that my life is pretty plain
  A                         G      E      E7
I like watchin' the puddles gather rain
    E                    D
And all I can do is just pour some tea for two
    A                         G         E     E7
and speak my point of view but it's not sane, It's not sane

[Chorus]
E              D             E           D           
   I just want    someone to say to me  oh,
E              D                  E      D 
   I'll always be there when you wake       yeah,
E                      D              E          D 
   Ya know I'd like to keep my cheeks dry today
E               D                   E      D
   so stay with me and I'll have it made

[Verse 2]
      E                      D   
And I don't understand why I sleep all day
      A                       G         E     E7 
And I start to complain that there's no rain
    E                      D 
And all I can do is read a book to stay awake
   A                           G           E 
It rips my life away, but it's a great escape

escape, escape, escape

[Solo]
E  D  E  D  (x2)

[Bridge]
E                        D
All I can say is that my life is pretty plain
        A
ya don't like my point of view
         G        E  
ya think that I'm insane
E  
Its not sane, it's not sane

[Chorus]
E              D             E           D           
   I just want    someone to say to me  oh,
E              D                  E      D 
   I'll always be there when you wake       yeah,
E                      D              E          D 
   Ya know I'd like to keep my cheeks dry today
E               D                   E      D
   so stay with me and I'll have it made

[Outro/Guitar Solo]

Oh oh oh oh
         E
Oh oh oh oh
