[Intro]
Em  Em  C  D  Em  Em

C                 D              Em  Em
Once upon a time, not so long ago

[Verse]
Em
Tommy used to work on the docks

Union's been on strike

He's down on his luck
     C     D   Em
It's tough, so tough
Em
Gina works the diner all day

Working for her man,

she brings home her pay
    C    D    Em
For love, for love

[Pre-Chorus]
                      C    G     D          Em
She says we've got to hold on to what we've got
          C              G
'Cause it doesn't make a difference
      D          Em
If we make it or not
      C        G         D        Em
We've got each other and that's a lot
    C           D           N.C.
For love, we'll give it a shot 

[Chorus]
Em  C         D
Whooah, we're half way there
G   C   D
Whooah, livin' on a prayer
Em      C              D
Take my hand and we'll make it I swear
G   C   D                    Em
Whooah, livin' on a prayer

[Verse]
Em
Tommy's got his six string in hock

Now he's holding in what he used

To make it talk
   C     D     Em
So tough, it's tough
Em
Gina dreams of running away

When she cries in the night

Tommy whispers:
           C    D Em
Baby it's okay, someday 

[Pre-Chorus]
                      C    G     D          Em
We've got to hold on to what we've got
          C              G
'Cause it doesn't make a difference
      D          Em
If we make it or not
      C        G         D        Em
We've got each other and that's a lot
    C           D           N.C.
For love, we'll give it a shot 

[Chorus]
Em  C         D
Whooah, we're half way there
G   C   D
Whooah, livin' on a prayer
Em      C              D
Take my hand and we'll make it I swear
G   C   D                   
Whooah, livin' on a prayer
C
livin' on a prayer...

[Solo]
Em  C  D  D
G   C  D  D
Em  C  D  D
G   C  Em Em

[Pre-Chorus]
             C    G   D        Em
We've got to hold on, ready or not
    C                       D
You live for the fight when that's all that you've got

[Chorus]
Gm  Eb        F
Whooah, we're half way there
Bb  Eb  F
Whooah, livin' on a prayer
Gm      Eb             F
Take my hand and we'll make it I swear
Bb  Eb  F
Whooah, livin' on a prayer    
Gm  Eb        F
Whooah, we're half way there
Bb  Eb  F

Take my hand and we'll make it I swear

Whooah, we're half way there
Bb  Eb  F
Whooah, livin' on a prayer

Take my hand and we'll make it I swear
