[Intro]
| Dm    | C  A# | x4
Dm                    C A#    Dm             C A#
Colours on the street,    Red white and blue
       Dm                    C A#         Dm                      C A#
People shufflin' their feet,       People sleepin' in their shoes
              Dm                  C     A#
But there's a warnin' sign on the road ahead
          Dm                           C           A#
There's a lot of people sayin' we'd be better off dead
      Dm                  C       A#
Don't feel like Satan but I'm to them
     Dm                  C      A#
so I try to forget it anyway I can

[Chorus]
F         C                        A# A# Dm
  Keep on rockin' in the free world
F         C                        A# A# Dm
  Keep on rockin' in the free world
F         C                        A# A# Dm
  Keep on rockin' in the free world
F         C                        A# A# Dm
  Keep on rockin' in the free world

[Verse 2]
        Dm                C A#      Dm                C A#
I see a girl in the night,   with a baby in her hand
         Dm                C A#       Dm          C A#
Under an old street light,     near a garbage can
        Dm                          C             A#
Now she puts the kid away and she's gone to get a hit
    Dm                            C       A#
She hates her life and what she's done to it
       Dm                     C           A#
That's one more kid that will never go to school
      Dm                        C         A#
Never get to fall in love never get to be cool

[Chorus]
F         C                        A# A# Dm
  Keep on rockin' in the free world
F         C                        A# A# Dm
  Keep on rockin' in the free world
F         C                        A# A# Dm
  Keep on rockin' in the free world
F         C                        A# A# Dm
  Keep on rockin' in the free world
