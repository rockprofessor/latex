[Verse]

   G                      Em
As I was going over - The Cork and Kerry Mountains
  C                             G
I saw Captain Farrell - And his money he was counting
  G                              Em
I first produced my pistol - And then produced my rapier
      C                            G
I said \&quot;Stand and deliver - Or the devil he may take ya\&quot;

| Em   | Em   | G    | G    | x2

  G                              Em
I took all of his money - And it was a pretty penny
  C                                   G
I took all of his money - Yeah, and I brought it home to Molly
    G                             Em
She swore that she loved me - No, never would she leave me
C                                              G
 But the devil take that woman - Yeah, for you know she tricked me easy


[Chorus]

      D
Musha rain dum-a-do dum-a-da
C
  Whack for my daddy-o
C
  Whack for my daddy-o
       G
There`s whiskey in the jar-o

| Em   | Em   | G    | G    | x2


[Verse]

G                         Em
Being drunk and weary - I went to Molly`s chamber
C                             G
 Taking Molly with me - But I never knew the danger
     G                               Em
For about six or maybe seven - Yeah, in walked Captain Farrell
C                                     G 
I jumped up, fired my pistols - And I shot him with both barrels


[Chorus]

      D
Musha rain dum-a-do dum-a-da
C
  Whack for my daddy-o
C
  Whack for my daddy-o
       G
There`s whiskey in the jar-o

[Verse]

    G                               Em
Now some men like the fishing - And some men like the fowling
C                                G
  And some men like to hear - To hear the cannonball a-roaring
G                       Em
Me, I like sleeping - Especially in my Molly`s chamber
C                                  G
  But here I am in prison - Here I am with a ball and chain, yeah


[Chorus]

      D
Musha rain dum-a-do dum-a-da
C
  Whack for my daddy-o
C
  Whack for my daddy-o
       G
There`s whiskey in the jar-o, yeah

| Em   | Em   | G    | G    |


[Outro]

      G
Musha rain dum-a-do dum-a-da
      G
Musha rain dum-a-do dum-a-da
      G
Musha rain dum-a-do dum-a-da
      G                       G
Musha rain dum-a-do dum-a-da
